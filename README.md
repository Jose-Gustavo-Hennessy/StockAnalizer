DISCLAIMER: This Project doesn't intend to calculate weather a stock will go up or down. It analizes hystorical data for patterns that signal a likely upward or downward change in price, however, its impossible to be sure the patter is right without also using Fundamental analysis and keeping in mind outside factors that may impact the price of a stock.

SUMMARY:
In summary, The Application uses Historical data to search for known patterns that descibe the behavior of the buyers and sellers in the market and what it indicates.

PATTERS:


DOJI CANDLE STICK PATTERN:
a Doji Pattern is when the open and close price are the same (within 5% for this project).
The Opening Price and Closing Price Being So close to each other, signifies indecision in the market.
on its own a Doji means little, however, it can often signal a reversal.

LONG-LEGGED DOJI CANDLE STICK PATTERN:
A Long-legged Doji, the "Normal" Doji, is a Doji which has around equal lengths of wick above and below, meaning that the price of a stock fluctuated equally up and down throughout the day. meaning there is no clear trend, however, if there has been a clear up or down trend in the market before this Doji this can often signal a reversal of that trend.

DRAGONFLY DOJI CANDLE STICK PATTERN:
A long-legged Doji is a Doji which has no top wick, or a bottom which is significantly longer than the top wick, meaning that the price of the stock was lower throughout the day. This means that although there were a lot of sales, there were more buyers at the end of the day. if this pattern appears during a downward trend, it can be a good indication of a reversal to an upward trend.

TOMBSTONE DOJI CANDLE STICK PATTERN:
A Tombstone Doji is a Doji which has no bottom wick, or a top which is significantly longer than the bottoom wick, meaning that the price of the stock was higher throughout the day. This means that although there were a lot of buys, there were more buyers at the end of the day. if this pattern appears during a upward trend, it can be a good indication of a reversal to an downward trend.

BEARISH ENGULFING CANDLE STICK PATTERN:
an Engulfing pattern is a pair of candles, where an upward candles is followed by a downward candle that is bigger and overwhelms the previous candle.
this pattern points to a shift from a upwards trend to downwards. the bigger the second candle compared to the first the stronger the posibility of a shift.
this pattern is very useful at the end of a pattern, however, its meaningless otherwise.


BULLISH ENGULFING CANDLE STICK PATTERN:
an Engulfing pattern is a pair of candles, where an downward candles is followed by a upward candle that is bigger and overwhelms the previous candle.
this pattern points to a shift from a downwards trend to upwards. the bigger the second candle compared to the first the stronger the posibility of a shift.
this pattern is very useful at the end of a pattern, however, its meaningless otherwise.
